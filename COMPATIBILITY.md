## Compatibility with OpenSearch

The below matrix shows the compatibility of the [`opensearch-go`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-go) with versions of [`OpenSearch`](https://opensearch.org/downloads.html#opensearch).

| Client Version | OpenSearch Version |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.0          | 1.x                |
| 2.x.0          | 1.3.13-2.11.0      |

## Upgrading

Major versions of OpenSearch introduce breaking changes that require careful upgrades of the client. While `opensearch-go-client` 2.0.0 works against the latest OpenSearch 1.x, certain deprecated features removed in OpenSearch 2.0 have also been removed from the client. Please refer to the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/index/) for more information.
